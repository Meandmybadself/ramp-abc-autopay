Caveat: This is a work-in-progress.  Your mileage may vary.

## Overview
The online platform at Minneapolis's Ramp ABC is the worst.  The worst part being the lack of auto-payment. Consider this a polyfill until they get their shit together.

## .env file
You'll need to create an .env file to define your personal account & payment details.  Make sure you don't commit it to a public git repository, cuz then people will steal your shit.

```
USERNAME='XXXX@XXXX.XXX'
PASSWORD='XXXXXX'
ACCOUNT_ID='XX-XXXXXX'
CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
CREDIT_CARD_CVV='XXX'
CREDIT_CARD_MONTH='XX'
CREDIT_CARD_YEAR='XX'
CREDIT_CARD_ZIP='XXXXX'
```
