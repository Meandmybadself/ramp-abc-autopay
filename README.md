# ramp-abc-autopay

Caveat: This is a work-in-progress.

## Overview
The online platform at Minneapolis's Ramp ABC is the worst.  The worst part being the lack of autopayment every month. Consider this a polyfill until they get their shit together.

## .env file
You'll need to create an .env file to define your personal account & payment details.  Make sure you don't commit it a public git repository.
